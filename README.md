# Burger-App

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, app displays the burger on the left side of the page--waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area has a Devour It! button. When the user clicks it, the burger moves to the right side of the page. Every burger is stored in a MySQL database, whether devoured or not.
